## LCD Jump Game with Arduino



This project implements a simple side-scrolling jump game using an Arduino and a 16x2 I2C LCD. The player controls a character that runs and jumps over obstacles. The game is designed to run on an Arduino with a joystick input and an LCD display.




## Components Required

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, etc.)
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- Joystick module or a push button
- Potentiometer for LCD contrast control
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Arduino IDE (Software)
## Game Logic

The character can be in various states (running, jumping, etc.) and moves across the screen.
Terrain is generated randomly and moves from right to left.
The player can jump over obstacles by pressing the joystick button.
The game ends if the character collides with an obstacle.
