## Arduino Sensor and LED Toggle


This Arduino project uses a sensor to toggle an LED on and off. When the sensor detects a signal, the LED will change its state (from off to on or from on to off).


## Components Required

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, etc.)
- LED
- Sensor (e.g., a push button or any digital input sensor)
- Resistors (as needed for the LED and sensor)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Arduino IDE (Software)
## How to Use

1. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Connect the sensor and LED as per the circuit diagram.
3. When the sensor detects a signal, the LED will toggle its state.
