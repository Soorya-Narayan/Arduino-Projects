## MQ2 Gas Sensor with LCD Display



This project uses the MQ2 gas sensor to measure the concentration of LPG, CO, and smoke in the air and displays the values on a 16x2 I2C LCD. The readings are updated every second.




## Components Required

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, etc.)
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- MQ2 Gas Sensor
- Potentiometer for LCD contrast control
- Breadboard (optional)
- Jumper wires
- Arduino IDE (Software)
## Libraries Required

**Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Arduino IDE:**

- MQ2
- LiquidCrystal_I2C




## How It Works

1. **Initialization** : The LCD and MQ2 sensor are initialized in the setup() function.
2. **Reading Values** : In the loop() function, the read() method of the MQ2 sensor is called to get the values of LPG, CO, and smoke.
3. **Displaying Values** : The readings are displayed on the 16x2 LCD, updating every second.
