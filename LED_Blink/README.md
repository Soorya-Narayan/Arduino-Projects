## LED Blink Project


This project demonstrates how to blink an LED using an Arduino. The LED is turned on and off with specified intervals.


## Components Needed

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, etc.)
- LED
- Resistor (220 ohm recommended)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires


## Connection

**Connect the components as follows:**

- Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to pin 13 of the Arduino.
- Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to one end of the resistor.
- Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin of the Arduino.


## How to Use

1. Connect your Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and copy the code into a new sketch.
3. Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
4. Upload the code to the Arduino.
5. The LED connected to pin 13 should start blinking with a 3-second interval.




## Customization

You can customize the blink intervals by changing the values of ``on_time`` and ``off_time`` variables in the code. For example, to have the LED on for 1 second and off for 2 seconds, you would set:

```cpp
int on_time = 1000;    // LED ON for 1 second
int off_time = 2000;   // LED OFF for 2 seconds


```
