## Weather Station Project




This project is a simple weather station that uses an OLED display, a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and an MQ-2 gas sensor to measure gas levels. The data is displayed on the OLED screen and also printed to the Serial Monitor.





### Components Required

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, etc.)
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- MQ2 Gas Sensor
- Breadboard (optional)
- Jumper wires
- Arduino IDE (Software)
### Libraries Required

**Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Arduino IDE:**

```cpp
Adafruit_GFX
Adafruit_SSD1306
DHT
```





### Usage



1. Connect the Arduino to your computer or power source.
2. Open the Serial Monitor (Ctrl+Shift+M) to view the readings.
3. Observe the temperature, humidity, and gas readings on the OLED display.
